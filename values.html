      <p>Values define how an organisation makes decisions, especially at risky turbulent
times. All organisations described in <a href="/casestudy/">Case Studies</a> live by
the values you find below. Some of these organisations explicitly state them
as their own values, others simply see them as basic blocks without which the
organisation won't survive.</p>

      <p>I believe these values are necessary conditions for any responsive organisation.</p>

      <div class="chapter">
          <h3 id="trust">Trust</h3>
          <p>Responsive organisations know their people are talented to make valuable
    decisions on their own, without requesting a permission from a gang of managers
    above them. Responsive organisations know their people are grown up and definitely
    capable to understand what is bad for the company, customers and colleagues and
    not to do it. Responsive organisations know their people are skilful to find
    the best solution or collaborate with colleagues to find one because they do it
    daily out of work.</p>

    <p>Responsive organisations trust their people to work autonomously, without constant
    monitoring and strict goal setting. They trust employees to decide what to do,
    how, with whom and when to do the job. It includes all spheres: sales, hiring,
    salaries and bonuses, investments, vacations, work time, procedures and so on.</p>

    <p>Being trusted employees pay back with trust, high engagement, creativity, loyalty
    and support.</p>

<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<p>When you trust people to make their own decisions you should open all available
information otherwise people won't be able to make an informed choice. In traditional
organisations in many case
you go for an advice to your manager because the manager didn't share important
data in the first hand. By making everything transparent - why and how decisions
are made, what financial state of the organisation, what difficulties the organisation
experiences - responsive organisations create an environment where everyone is
motivated to care about prosperity and success of his colleagues, company,
clients and his own.</p>

<p>High level of trust and transparency form a positive reinforcement loop: more
transparency brings deeper trust and deeper trust increases the desire to share more.
The opposite is also true - low level of trust and transparency form a negative
reinforcement loop.</p>

<p>Trust and transparency is an egg-chicken problem - you cannot say that one is more
important than the other as they simply don't exist separately for long.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>
<p>Work/life balance is an awful concept. It assumes work and life are separated
and this is logically incorrect - you cannot work being dead :). Work/personal life
balance has more sense. However, the assumption about the separation is the same
and not good.</p>

<p>You cannot make a parent concentrate on work if her child is in hospital. You
cannot stop a person thinking about a successful product launch while he
is enjoying a family dinner.</p>

<p>Most people unconsciously blend their families, hobbies, friends and themselves
one tightly-tangled clew and keep work outside of the equation. It's unhealthy
because we express ourselves through work and
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/thisemotionallife/topic/happiness/what-happiness"
target="_blank">self-expression</a> is essential for our happiness.</p>

<p>What responsive organisations strive for is to make work a natural part of your
life like family, hobby or friends. It could be implemented in many ways: kids,
spouses and pets in the office, flexible working hours, remote work, joint events,
yoga and meditation classes, music bands and many more.</p>
