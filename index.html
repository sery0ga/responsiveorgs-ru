        <p>This project is my attempt to show the beauty of organisations where
        people are trusted to use their talents to have their job done. </p>
        <p>There is no invention on my side. All I did is I put together
        many scattered pieces of information from articles, books and talks. Sometimes
        it was easy (like <a href="/casestudy/favi.html" class="label label-success">FAVI</a>),
        sometimes - not (like <a href="/casestudy/github.html" class="label label-success">Github</a>).
        <p>The website consists of three sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/casestudy/">Case Studies</a> contains examples of
            responsive organisations</li>
            <li><a href="/values.html">Values</a> contains a set of basic values
            which in my opinion are necessary conditions for any responsive organisation</li>
            <li><a href="/approaches.html">Approaches</a> contains a collection
            of methods, approaches and tools used by at least 2-3 organisations</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="responsive">Why responsive?</h3>
        <p>There are many names for organisations of the future. Rob Collins calls
        them <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wiki-Management-Revolutionary-Changing-Collaborative/dp/0814433081"
        target="_blank">Wiki</a>. Dave Gray - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Connected-Company-Dave-Gray/dp/144931905X"
        target="_blank">Connected</a>. Niels Pflaeging - <a href="http://www.betacodex.org/"
        target="_blank">Beta</a>. Frederic Laloux - <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/"
        target="_blank">Teal</a>. Stelio Verzera - <a href="http://liquido.cocoonprojects.com/"
        target="_blank">Liquid</a>. Probably the most well-known name is <b>Networked</b>.
        </p>
        <p>Some names I like more, some - less. For example, <b>Connected</b> and
        <b>Networked</b> put too much focus on structure and less - on humans.
        <b>Beta</b> and <b>Teal</b> require to know the supportive models
        to understand these definitions. I prefer the name <a href="http://theresponsiveorg.com"
        target="_blank"><b>Responsive</b></a> because it's more descriptive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organisational structure responds to outside signals and transforms
            to attend market needs</li>
            <li>Organisations are responsive and attentive to folks' need (thanks to
            <a href="https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/the-antimatter-principle/"
            target="_blank">Bob Marshall</a>). All stakeholders are included: employees,
            customers, shareholders, community, environment.</li>
        </ul>
