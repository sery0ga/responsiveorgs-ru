      <p>Github Inc. is a company of <a href="https://github.com/about/team"
      target="_blank">238 people</a> founded in 2008 by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo"
      target="_blank">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, <a href="https://github.com/defunkt"
      target="_blank">Chris Wanstrath</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pjhyett"
      target="_blank">PJ Hyett</a> to simplify code sharing. These days almost 8
      million people use Github to collaborate across <a href="https://github.com/about/press"
      target="_blank">17.5M repositories</a>. In June 2012 Andreessen Horowitz
      <a href="http://peter.a16z.com/2012/07/09/software-eats-software-development/"
      target="_blank">invested</a> $100 million in Github - the biggest investment
      made by Andreessen Horowitz.
      </p>
      <p>Github provides free repository storage for public projects and paid plans
      for private.</p>

      <p>Before moving further it’s important for you to understand a little bit
      their main product <b>github.com</b> because sometimes it’s difficult to say where
      the company ends and the product begins - so deeply it is ingrained into their
      processes. Github is a service for developers to collaborate on their products
      by sharing code, discussing it with others and making contributions. The
      service allows developers around the world to create software in an
      asynchronous manner.</p>

      <p><i>Pull Request</i> is a basic principle of Github. Let’s imagine you made
      an awesome new “Send Me” feature for an email application. To see this feature
      live you create a <i>Pull Request</i> with the code containing the feature and
      wait for others to check and approve it. As soon as others agree it’s a cool
      feature to have your code is merged to the codebase.</p>

      <p>Their motto:</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
          We build software for people that build software
      </div>
      <p>The story of the company started with three founders who wanted to make a
      service helping developers around the world collaborate on their products.
      Besides that they wanted to create a developer-oriented company where people
      would love working and shipping great stuff. Being developers themselves and
      energized by how open software is developed they based the company on similar
      principles.</p>

      <p><b>Distributed</b>: All work should be done remotely. About 60%-70% of
      their ~250 employees are remote workers living in different countries,
      travelling around the world or simply being too lazy to commute to the office
      daily.</p>

      <p><b>Asynchronous</b>: Try to keep the amount of real-time communication at
      a minimum level. As they want to stay distributed company being asynchronous
      is the only sane way to stay productive.</p>

      <p><b>No managers / Everyone is a manager</b>: Everyone is responsible for
      shipping great stuff and it’s up to you to decide how you do it.</p>

  <h3 id="roles">Roles / Structure</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Github is a network of teams working in parallel on multiple products/features.
      Each team defines how it’s going to ship and there’s no common rule for
      everyone. However some teams and products have a <b>primarily responsible
      person (PRP)</b>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <p>And we have PRP for everything. You can PRP whole teams, you can PRP
        specific events or features or blogposts. […] It basically means that
        there’s a person whose job is to make sure that something ships. Or make
        sure that that is stable. Or make sure we can go to them for an estimation
        on how the project is going.</p>

      <p>They try to keep teams small, 3-4 persons. It keeps innovation on a high
      level, decreases an informational noise and people are more engaged. Githubers
      have bad experience with products being developed by many people at once.
      They create high-level vision and plans for bigger products (like Github:Enterprise)
      but implement them on lower levels.</p>

  <h3 id="information-flow">Information Flow</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>To make a rational decision what to do people should have as much information
      in hands as possible. All information in Github is available to everyone.
      They constantly search for new ways to decrease noise and make the information
      more valuable to everyone at the same time.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For everyday communication they use Basecamp. It’s a team-communication platform where they create “rooms”. Everyone can join any room and takes part in the discussion. These days they have around 150 rooms.</li>
        <li>Their main product - Github - is built around their values so they use it a lot in their communication and development process. If a Githubber wants to get an opinion on a feature from another team or a colleague, she mentions the team or the colleague the same way we mention people in Twitter.</li>
        <li>Every Friday they have beer night which starts at 16:30 and is dedicated to informal communication. It starts with CEO sharing general stuff which everyone may find interesting.</li>
        <li>Every month CEO shares profits and loss data.</li>

  <h3 id="decision-making">Decision-making</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>In Github open allocation is used. Basically it means people choose what
      they work on.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <p>Step one starts with you. What do you want to work on? What's the best use
        of your time? It's a personal thing, but very few features and products are
        taken on at GitHub by yourself. Typically we want to build at least two-person
        teams (a designer and a developer), although three-person teams are preferable
        (a designer and two developers, usually). So the first step is to actually
        find other people to work on something with you.</p>

        <p>I've had a few really great ideas over the years of really awesome things
        I've wanted to work on, and sure, you get people saying "yeah that'd be
        awesome to have!" But then I couldn't find anyone to work on it with me.
        That's a huge indicator. It's easy to get people to agree with you, but if
        you can't convince them to donate their time to make the vision a reality,
        it's a massive signal that what you're doing isn't great.</p>

      <p>Most of the time it works well. However, when an argument couldn't be resolved
      this way leaders are asked for help. Leaders are people who have been working
      on products for several years and understand the context much better than
      others.</p>

        <p>Everyone's opinion doesn't matter equally. My opinion as a bystander just
        floating by a project's pull request matters much less than the team that's
        been working day-in, day-out on that particular pull for three months now.
        The team's opinion defers to the leadership of the project itself. It's not
        some weird power scramble, either: almost in all cases it just comes down
        to experience, and if you've been living and breathing something for four
        years, there's a good chance you have a deep context that others new to
        the project don't have.</p>

      <p>Though leaders’ opinion has more weight it’s an advice, not an order. At

        <p>… if you're at the point where you need someone else to come in and mediate
        a massive fight on a pull request, it's almost always a sign that both sides
        are idiots and you should go back to the drawing board and figure out a
        different way. It's one of those cases where whatever problem you're
        facing is probably just a really hard problem with valid concerns from
        both parties.</p>

      It seems like Githubbers have no problems with budget limits. They can start
      any project they want if they find enough people to work with them on it.
      In addition their costs are mostly time-related as they have no expensive
      equipment to buy.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        <p>Say for example we're working on a project together, and I'm not working as
        hard as I should be, or the work I'm doing isn't very great. Usually all that
        needs to happen is either I approach you and ask if there's anything I could
        improve on (or ask you for help with something that's contributing to my poor
        performance), or you come to me and bring up your concerns. It's really
        pretty informal- think drinks, rather than a board meeting.</p>
        <p>Just because we're self-managed doesn't mean we operate independently. A
        lot of this happens in teams. If we're working on the same team on the same
        project, I really want you to do well, because it makes my job easier and
        makes for a better project. And nine times out of ten it's not that I'm a
        shitty person or a shitty employee- maybe I just am hammered with some personal
        reasons at home, or I'm swamped with another project, or just a multitude of
        other reasons. Keeping these conversations informal reduces the stress and
        increases the frequency of having them, and you end up avoiding a lot of
        unpleasantness down the line if you can nip it in the bud early.</p>

      <p>The process of hiring is pretty informal. The goal of the whole procedure

        <li><p><b>Step 1 - remote interviews.</b> You talk with a bunch of
        Githubbers using by email and video calls.</p>
        <p><i>"It wasn’t moving fast, from time to time I waited for more than a week to get a response or to schedule a call time. I’ll be lying if I say I wasn’t bothered by that, but it was really pleasant nonetheless, here’s why: when people replied me late, they told me they were going to be late, and why they were. They make the effort to drop me a short email only to make sure I know what is going on.”</i>, <a

        <li><b><p>Step 2 - on-site interview in San-Francisco.</b> It consists of several very informal meetings with people you may work with and other random Githubbers. There are no theoretical questions and quizzes. You’ll have one or two one-hour working sessions on some real issues but most of the time you’ll chat and/or have meals with your future colleagues. Your
        interactions are not limited to people of your skills (like developers or designers).</p>
        <p><i>"I talked to developers, designers and also to my surprise – the finance team! Normally when interviewing at a company, I will expect seeing developers, project managers or so, not people from a whole different department, but this was brilliant! People were not hard-divided into certain groups simply because they were non-techs working in a tech company or something. I enjoyed very much talking to @hotbootymasala, who used to live in London like me, and @alysonla, who codes quite a lot now!”</i>, <a

        from Taiwan but I live in London and so on. It is surprising how rare this is
        the case, and this tells me that they took the time to get to know me, not
        just by looking at my resume, but actually took the time to read through
